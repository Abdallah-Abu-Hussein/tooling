# Coding and implementation technique :

We will Follow the code style we have learned throughout this course. We will use meaningful and descriptive names for all files, variables, function names. We will Follow best practices with casing, spacing, and indentation.
Our team will decide on standard naming conventions to use throughout the project and hold each other accountable to these standards.
The code base should also follow similar code organization from file to file. For example, all the files that affect application styling will follow similar patterns and syntax.

# Testing technique

White Box testing , because we don't have QA team , testing is mostly done by  developers , who have knowledge about the internal structure of the code of the software.
