# Coding and implementation technique :

We will Follow the code style we have learned throughout this course. We used meaningful and descriptive names for all files, variables, function names. We Follow best practices with casing, spacing, and indentation.
Our team will decide on standard naming conventions to use throughout the project and hold each other accountable to these standards.
The code base should also follow similar code organization from file to file. For example, all the files that affect application styling will follow similar patterns and syntax.
